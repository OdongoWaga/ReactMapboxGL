# ReactMapbox

An example of a custom map component for React, built using Mapbox via the react-map-gl wrapper.

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

To get this up and running, follow these steps: 

1) cd ReactMapbox
2) npm install
3) npm start

There are currently issues regarding the use of WebGL used on Google Chrome, so this can component can be viewed in other browsers, but this should be considered when using this.
